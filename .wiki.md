# Project Summary
The project is a web-based Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculator designed to help users compute their investment returns over a specified period. Built with React, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, the application enables users to input financial data, such as start and end dates and balances, to derive a clear percentage result of the IRR. It emphasizes user experience through input validation, error handling, and a responsive interface, making it accessible for individuals interested in financial analysis.

# Project Module Description
- **IRR Calculator**: This module accepts user inputs for start date, end date, beginning balance, and ending balance, calculates the IRR, and displays the result. It includes input validation, error handling, comma separators for numerical inputs, and a responsive design.
